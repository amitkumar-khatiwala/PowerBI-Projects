Project-1: #New-York-City-Airbnb-Open-Data-Analysis
The is a captone project conducted for Data Analytics Career track, Springboard from 08/23/2022 - 09/15/2022 to analyze New York City Airbnb Open Data of size 102,599. This analysis aims to explore the pricing with neighborhoods, room type, and hosts review rating that may be valuable to the public. Then also focusing on other questions like
Which are the top neighborhoods, their average prices, and the number of listings?
What is the percentage share of different room types?
How does the pricing vary with location, property type, and reviews?
What are the correlations between the type of hosts and factors like- reviews & price?

In this project I have used Python and Power BI separatly.

Libraries used are: Python Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, scipy were used to perform Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and correlations identification.
In Power BI, I have used Power Query Editor to clean the data, transformed and shaped data to for analysis. Created Visual charts to answer above questions.

IDE used: Jupyter note book & Microsoft Power BI.



Project-2: #AtlasLab HR Analysis Case Study

In this Power BI case study, I have explored a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. First, I imported, analyzed, and visualized Human Resources data in Power BI. Then I conducted exploratory data analysis and used DAX to help build powerful visualizations. I have finished my analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. Lastly, the final result will help the organization to determine what action it will need to take to retain more employees.

IDE used: Microsoft Power BI.
